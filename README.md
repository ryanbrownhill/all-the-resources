#Books:

##Learning UX Books:

These are the book I recommend to anyone who is interesting in learning UX processes. They are in order from what I would say is most important to least.

1. [This is Service Design Thinking- ](http://www.amazon.com/This-Service-Design-Thinking-Basics/dp/1118156307/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961298&sr=1-1&keywords=this+is+service+design+thinking&pebp=1418961299763)
This book is a great primer to what service design is and the tools that they use. This taught me a lot about user research and how to design for things that are not tangible.

2. [Designing for the digital age-]
(http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Digital-Age-Human-Centered-Products/dp/0470229101/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961284&sr=1-1&keywords=designing+for+the+digital+age&pebp=1418961286348)
Amazing book very dense and a long read but it was the first book I read about designing for interaction and products. It shows how the product design world is structured.

3. [Designing Interface-](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Interfaces-Jenifer-Tidwell/dp/1449379702/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1B8EM0PGB9KCQW1JRT2Z)
Goes though everything interface in detail.

4. [How to Make Sense of Any Mess](http://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Sense-Any-Mess/dp/1500615994/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961437&sr=1-1&keywords=make+sense+of+any+mess&pebp=1418961440157)
Amazing book about information architecture

5. [Don’t Make me Think-]
(http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961361&sr=1-1&keywords=don%27t+make+me+think&pebp=1418961362533)
Great book about designing intuitive interaction and information design 

6. [101 design methods-] 
(http://www.amazon.com/101-Design-Methods-Structured-Organization/dp/1118083466/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961312&sr=1-1&keywords=101+design+methods&pebp=1418961313509)
Real good methods for design thinking

7. [MicroInteractions - ](http://www.amazon.com/Microinteractions-Full-Color-Designing-Details/dp/1491945923/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961325&sr=1-1&keywords=microinteractions&pebp=1418961326860)
Great quick read about designing very very small interactions.

8. [Service Design- ](http://www.amazon.com/Service-Design-Implementation-Andy-Polaine/dp/1933820330/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961335&sr=1-1&keywords=service+design)
This is another great book about service design. Very similar to the “This is service design thinking"

9. [Human Centered Design- ](http://www.amazon.com/Human-Centered-Design-Toolkit-Open-Source-Developing/dp/0984645705/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418961346&sr=1-4&keywords=human+centered+design&pebp=1418961349898)
Interesting book about human centered design concept.
